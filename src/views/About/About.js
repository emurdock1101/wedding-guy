    //       Something very like the war fever that occasionally runs through a civilised community had
    //       got into my blood, and in my heart I was not so very sorry that I had to return to Maybury
    //       that night. I was even afraid that that last fusillade I had heard might mean the
    //       extermination of our invaders from Mars. I can best express my state of mind by saying
    //       that I wanted to be in at the death. It was nearly eleven when I started to return. The
    //       night was unexpectedly dark; to me, walking out of the lighted passage of my cousins'
    //       house, it seemed indeed black, and it was as hot and close as the day. Overhead the clouds
    //       were driving fast, albeit not a breath stirred the shrubs about us. My cousins' man lit
    //       both lamps. Happily, I knew the road intimately. My wife stood in the light of the
    //       doorway, and watched me until I jumped up into the dog cart. Then abruptly she turned and
    //       went in, leaving my cousins side by side wishing me good hap.
