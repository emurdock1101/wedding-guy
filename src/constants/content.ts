The interpretations of the test have come from dilgent research, study, and clinical practice. If you are curious about diving into your own research, we would point you the Oxford Handbook of the Five Factor Model, Dr. C.G. DeYoung and Dr. J.B.

However, this test was created so that the results and reports generate after the test could be cost effective, clearer, more precise, more user friendly, and most importantly, useable. By useable, we mean providing the results in a way that can help you implement practical changes in your life, self-reflections, or desire to connect with a mental health therapist.",

Furthermore, if you take the test, and then look at your results, and then re-take it, your second results could introduce biases by your now-expanded knowledge of your personality. That means you could alter your responses (consciously or unconsciously), which would change your results.",

      part1:
        "First, remember that this is a self-report test, scored comparatively, using statistical processes. The manner in which you describe yourself has been compared to the manner in which many other people described themselves. If you received results that you do not regard as accurate (and this is more likely to be the case when the report describes more negative personality attributes) it is possible that you were too hard on yourself when you answered the questions. This is more probable if you are higher, rather than lower, in trait neuroticism (as people higher in neuroticism are more self-critical), or if you were in a bad mood when you took the test, or if you are depressed, or hungry or ill.",
      part2:
        "Second, remember that the traits and aspects have to be considered in combination, rather than singly. So, for example, you might be very or extremely high in Agreeableness. You therefore received feedback on the report stating that you have a hard time standing up for yourself, and are generally more concerned with the feelings and desires of other people. However, if you are also high in assertiveness (an aspect of Extraversion) and/or low in Neuroticism then you are more likely to say what you want and put your needs forward than an agreeable person low in the former and high in the latter. If you are low in Conscientiousness, you are less likely to be successful in school and in managerial and administrative jobs—but if you have a high IQ and low Neuroticism then your chances of success rise substantially. Furthermore, you could be low in Conscientiousness but high in Openness to Experience and be successful as a creative person or entrepreneur.",
